# Project Overview
For my 'Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming' module, I created a program using the Tkinter library. This program features a GUI that allows users to draw various shapes in different colors.

While I found Tkinter to be somewhat outdated and challenging to use, I enjoyed this project. Seeing my programming efforts reflected visually on a GUI, rather than just a terminal, was a refreshing and rewarding experience.
